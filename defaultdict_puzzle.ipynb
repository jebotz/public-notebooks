    "# A Python puzzle: Using a series of increasing default values for defaultdict\n",
    "\n",
    "This page came out of a simple little coding puzzle Aaron Maxwell, author of [_Powerful Python_](https://powerfulpython.com/) had sent to his mailing list: how to use default of 1 with a Python defaultdict.  I answered this with `defaultdict(lambda: 1)`, and then I thought of making this a bit harder and coming up with a way to make the default value non-constant, for example a sequence.  This turned into an interesting exploration of callables and persisting state between calls (without using global variables, of course) in the Python language."

This works because 0 is the default `int`, i.e. what the int class (the int constructor) returns when it's called without arguments.

This turns out to be pretty easy, by extending the `__new__` dunder method and keeping track of the count in a class attribute.

    "## 4) Using a lexical closure\n",
    "\n",
    "Lexical closures are a way for a function object to maintain state long-term that's heavily used in Scheme and some other Lisp-y or functional languages, not so much in Python where objects are usually preferred.  But at least in Python 3 it is possible to solve this puzzle with a lexical closoure, although there are some gotchas... specifically, we need to use a [`nonlocal`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-nonlocal-stmt) declaration for the count variable.  Also, in Scheme the inner function would usually be a lambda since it really doesn't need a name, but in Python lambdas are deliberately limited to avoid them having side effects (like updating `count`).  I dug a bit into the reasons for this limitation, and without going into all the details, what it comes down to is that Guido van Rossum wants to encourage a very explicit style in Python and thinks that in all but the most trivial cases a named function is  always preferrable to a lambda.  In fact, at one point he intended to [remove lambda from the language altogether](https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196). Upon reflection I think that the limited lambdas are fine for Python; if I want to code in a functional style I'll use a fully functional language.  And anyone who really wants code Python in a fully functional style can try [Coconut](coconut-lang.org)!  But it's good to know that we do have the functionality of lexical closures available in plain Python and of course Python functions are still first class objects, even if they do have to have a name."

    "Novice Python programmers often trip over this (see i.e. this [page about Python gotchas](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/gotchas)) but another way for a function to maintain state between invocations in Python is via a mutable default argument.  This is a consequence of the fact that in Python arguments are always passed by reference combined with the fact that Python evaluates default arguments at function definition time.  So if a default argument is a mutable object, for example a list, as in `def f(l=[])`, then it will be created only once and any changes made to it will persist between calls (as opposed to, in this case, `l` being re-initialized to an empty list on each call, which is what the programmer might have intended).

Although it may seem like we're abusing some unintended behavior, in some cases this may actually be more readable and/or predictable than a real lexical closure, and therefor might be preferred.  Like a lexical closure a mutable default argument provides a strong form of encapsulation (by Python standards)... if the mutable object is created as part of the function's definition, then only that function can change it.  A caller can temporarily _override_ it, but they can't _overwrite_ it!
