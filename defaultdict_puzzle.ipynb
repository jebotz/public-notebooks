    "# A Python puzzle: Ways of using a sequence of values with defaultdict\n",
    "\n",
    "This page came out of a simple little coding puzzle Aaron Maxwell, author of [_Powerful Python_](https://powerfulpython.com/) had sent to his mailing list: how to use default of 1 with a Python defaultdict.  My answer to this was `defaultdict(lambda: 1)`, and then I thought of making this a bit harder and coming up with a way to make the default value non-constant, for example a sequence.  This turned into an interesting exploration of callables and persisting state between calls (without using global variables, of course) in the Python language."

    "The Python `dict` type (_associative array_ or _hash_ in some other languages) has the semantics that if you try to look up a key that doesn't exist it raises a _KeyError_ exception.  This is fine for many use cases, but it makes some other uses cases unnecessarily complicated.   An example is using a dict to count the number of occurences of individual words in some source text; the following would be a concise and simple solution, but doesn't work..."

    "\n",
    "This was actually the first solution I envisioned when I started thinking about this problem... The manual entry for defaultdict gives the example of `defaultdict(int)` for default elements of 0. This works because 0 is the default `int` when you call the int class (int type constructor) without arguments.  So we should be able to create a subclass of `int` that makes a serialized default instance instead.  This turns out to be pretty easy, using and extending the `__new__` dunder method and keeping the count in a class attribute.  A `SerialInt` is a normal integer except that its default is a serial number rathern than 0."

This is a consequence of the fact that in Python arguments are always passed by reference combined with the fact that Python evaluates default arguments at function definition time.  This means that if a default argument is mutable, for example a list, as in `f(l=[])`, then any changes made to it will persist between calls (rather than, in this case, `l` being re-initialized to an empty list on each call, which is what the programmer might have intended).  This is absolutely correct behavior, but can be surprising.\n",

    "\n",
    "Lexical closures are a way for a function object to maintain state between invocations that's heavily used in Lisp, not so much in Python where objects are usually preferred.  But at least in Python 3 it is possible, although there are some gotchas... specifically, we need to use a [`nonlocal`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-nonlocal-stmt) declaration for the count variable.  Also, in Lisp the inner function would usually be a lambda since it really doesn't need a name, but in Python lambdas are deliberately too limited to have side effects (like updating `count`).  I spent some time researching the reasons for this limitation, and without going into the details, what it comes down to is that Python should be Python and not try to be Lisp.  It does makes sense, but it's good to know that we do have the power of lexical closures available and functions are still first class objects even if they do have to have a name."
